              Today, I will talk to you about treaties, focusing on Treaty One.
              But first, what are treaties? A treaty, in its simplest form, is a
              formal, legally binding agreement between two or more nations,
              often governed by international law. These agreements define
              various aspects of relationships between nations, such as trade,
              security, and resource management.
