        <!-- Treaty One introduction -->
        What is Treaty One? Treaty One was an agreement signed on August 3, 1871, at
        Lower Fort Garry, Manitoba. It was made between the British Crown (European
        settlers) <span style="color: rgb(158, 60, 132)"> leaders of seven First Nations</span>
        The Anishinaabe and The Cree people. The treaty was made to show how the
        land would be divided and how the government would support First Nations
        communities. But there were misunderstandings and disagreements about what
        the treaty really was.

      <p>
        Now another question is Why Did First Nations Sign Treaty One?  
        The reason First Nations leaders signed the treaty was because change was happening quicker than they liked. A lot more settlers were coming to their land, and they wanted to find a way to coexist peacefully. They also needed support. The buffalo, a main food source, was disappearing, and they hoped the treaty would help provide food, education, and farming tools to stop them from starving. They also believed in sharing land, not surrendering it. First Nations people had lived on the land for thousands of years and believed it should be shared rather than owned by one group.
      </p>

      <p>Why Did the Government Want the Treaty?
        <!-- Reasons for government wanting treaty -->
        The British government and other settlers wanted the treaty because. They Wanted More Land They planned to build farms, towns, and railways in the Red River Valley and around Lake Winnipeg. They also Wanted Peace There were conflicts in the United States between settlers and Indigenous peoples, and the government wanted to avoid similar conflicts in Canada. They finally Wanted Natural Resources The land was rich in resources, which the government wanted to control and use for profit.
      </p>

      <p>What Happened After the Treaty Was Signed?
        <!-- Issues following the signing -->
        After Treaty One was signed, problems began. The Government Took most of the Land  The First Nations thought they were agreeing to share the land, but the government treated it as a full surrender and didn’t hold back. Promises Were Not Kept The government did not provide all the food, money, and farming tools that were promised. Land Was Taken Without Permission Some First Nations reserves were made smaller than promised and some land was given to settlers instead.
        These broken promises led to disagreements and protests that continue today.
      </p>

      <p>Why Is Treaty One Still Important Today?
        <!-- Importance of Treaty One -->
        Treaty One is still important because it affects Land Rights the First Nations leaders are still working to get the land and support they were promised. Treaty Responsibilities – The government is responsible for upholding its promises to First Nations peoples.
        Reconciliation Canadians today are learning more about treaties to respect Indigenous rights and work toward fairness.
        Treaty One was meant to create peace and cooperation, but misunderstandings and broken promises caused problems. Understanding these treaties helps us learn from the past and work toward a better future.
